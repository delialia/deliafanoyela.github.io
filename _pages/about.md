I'm a fourth year PhD student in the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London. Under the supervision of Mark Sandler and <a href="http://www.mcld.co.uk">Dan Stowell</a> (and previously Sebastian Ewert now in Spotify), I work on signal processing and graph theory methods for sound source separation and music analysis. I'm also interested in similarity and representation of music signals.

Before starting the PhD in London, I received my masters degree in Music & Technology (MSc) from the <a href="https://csm.cit.ie/">Cork School of Music</a> and was awarded with the highest-placed taught masters in Music & Technology CSM prize in 2015. My thesis on noise reduction using sound source separation was supervised by Dr. Derry FitzGerald.

Before that, I received a masters degree in Electronic Systems (MEng) with major in Nanotechnology from the <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/">Dublin City University</a> and studied electrical characterisation of defects in semiconductors materials in my thesis supervised by Prof. Patrick McNally.

My bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering was previously awarded by the <a href="https://www.insa-lyon.fr/">Institut National des Sciences Appliquees (INSA) Lyon</a>. In between finishing the masters and starting the PhD, I worked for a while as an R&D Engineer in Gentian Services, Ireland.

I'm also the founder and organiser of the <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4193488"> Hands-on Source Separation Workshop (HOSSS)</a> series aiming to bring together experts and students in the field for a day of active brainstorming and hacking.
